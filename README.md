## Project Description

### Motivation
After learning Asynchronous Javascript, React, Redux, Passport and SQL, I wanted to build an app that uses React as its front-end framework, incorporates Redux to the view for managing the client’s internal state, communicates with a server that’s configured with Passport.js, and is able to connect to a relational database. In short, I aimed for a full-stack development process. 

### What I learned

*    Starting from scratch is not easy especially to starters, so I took the main idea from a project that’s built by a team of much more experienced developers from Codecademy.com. In that way, I was able to focus on coding without worrying about what content and design the app should have. It makes me feel more confident when I can compare my solution to an existing robust solution. 

*    Being enough careful is seemly unapproachable. What makes an error occur or having an unexpected outcome is not because I haven’t made the largest amount of effort or something wrong with my comprehension ability while trying to incorporate a more advanced feature such as Redux thunk. I can simply be blind to the code that I never think I should go wrong with.
